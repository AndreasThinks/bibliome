- **JavaScript**: HTMX for dynamic interactions

## 🗄️ Database Migrations

Bibliome uses **fastmigrate** for database schema management, providing version control for your database structure and safe schema evolution.

### How It Works

FastMigrate follows the standard database migration pattern:
- **Migration scripts** define database versions (e.g., `0001-initialize.sql`, `0002-add-feature.sql`)
- **Automatic application** of pending migrations on startup
- **Version tracking** ensures each migration runs exactly once
- **Safe evolution** from any previous version to the latest

### Migration Files

Migration scripts are stored in the `migrations/` directory:

```
migrations/
└── 0001-initialize.sql    # Initial database schema
```

Each migration file:
- **Must be numbered sequentially** (0001, 0002, 0003, etc.)
- **Should have a descriptive name** after the number
- **Contains SQL statements** to modify the database
- **Runs exactly once** when the application starts

### Current Schema (Version 1)

The initial migration (`0001-initialize.sql`) creates all necessary tables:
- `user` - Bluesky user profiles and authentication data
- `bookshelf` - Book collections with privacy and metadata  
- `book` - Individual books with metadata from Google Books API
- `permission` - Role-based access control for bookshelves
- `bookshelf_invite` - Invitation system for sharing
- `upvote` - User votes on books for curation
- `activity` - Tracks user actions for the social feed

### Adding New Migrations

When you need to modify the database schema:

1. **Create a new migration file** in the `migrations/` directory:
   ```bash
   # Example: Adding a new column to the book table
   touch migrations/0002-add-book-rating.sql
   ```

2. **Write the SQL changes**:
   ```sql
   -- migrations/0002-add-book-rating.sql
   -- Add rating column to books table
   
   ALTER TABLE book ADD COLUMN rating INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
   CREATE INDEX idx_book_rating ON book(rating);
   ```

3. **Test the migration**:
   ```bash
   # The migration will run automatically when you start the app
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Verify the changes**:
   ```bash
   # Check current database version
   python -c "from fastmigrate.core import get_db_version; print(f'Database version: {get_db_version(\"data/bookdit.db\")}')"
   ```

### Migration Best Practices

#### ✅ Do's
- **Always backup** your database before running migrations in production
- **Test migrations** on a copy of production data first
- **Use descriptive names** for migration files
- **Keep migrations small** and focused on one change
- **Add indexes** for new columns that will be queried
- **Use transactions** for complex multi-step migrations

#### ❌ Don'ts
- **Never modify existing migration files** once they've been applied
- **Don't skip version numbers** (use sequential numbering)
- **Avoid destructive operations** without careful consideration
- **Don't mix schema and data changes** in the same migration

### CLI Commands

FastMigrate provides command-line tools for database management:

```bash
# Check current database version
fastmigrate_check_version --db data/bookdit.db

# Create a new managed database (if needed)
fastmigrate_create_db --db data/bookdit.db

# Run pending migrations manually
fastmigrate_run_migrations --db data/bookdit.db --migrations migrations/

# Check what migrations would run
ls migrations/ | sort
```

### Example Migration Scenarios

#### Adding a New Feature
```sql
-- migrations/0002-add-book-reviews.sql
-- Add book reviews functionality

CREATE TABLE book_review (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    book_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    user_did TEXT NOT NULL,
    rating INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5),
    review_text TEXT DEFAULT '',
    created_at DATETIME,
    updated_at DATETIME,
    FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES book(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_did) REFERENCES user(did)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_book_review_book ON book_review(book_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_book_review_user ON book_review(user_did);
CREATE INDEX idx_book_review_rating ON book_review(rating);
```

#### Modifying Existing Data
```sql
-- migrations/0003-normalize-book-authors.sql
-- Split author field into separate authors table

CREATE TABLE book_author (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    book_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    author_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    author_order INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
    FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES book(id)
);

-- Migrate existing author data
INSERT INTO book_author (book_id, author_name, author_order)
SELECT id, author, 1 
FROM book 
WHERE author IS NOT NULL AND author != '';

CREATE INDEX idx_book_author_book ON book_author(book_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_book_author_name ON book_author(author_name);
```

### Troubleshooting Migrations

#### Migration Failed
If a migration fails:
1. **Check the error message** in the application logs
2. **Fix the SQL syntax** in the migration file
3. **Restore from backup** if the database is corrupted
4. **Test the fixed migration** on a copy first

#### Database Version Mismatch
If you see version-related errors:
```bash
# Check current version
fastmigrate_check_version --db data/bookdit.db

# List available migrations
ls -la migrations/

# Manually run migrations if needed
fastmigrate_run_migrations --db data/bookdit.db --migrations migrations/
```

#### Rolling Back Changes
FastMigrate doesn't support automatic rollbacks, but you can:
1. **Create a new migration** that reverses the changes
2. **Restore from a backup** taken before the migration
3. **Manually fix** the database if the change was small

### Production Deployment

For production deployments:

1. **Backup the database** before deploying:
   ```bash
   cp data/bookdit.db data/bookdit.db.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
   ```

2. **Test migrations** on a copy of production data first

3. **Deploy with automatic migrations**:
   - Migrations run automatically when the application starts
   - Monitor logs for migration success/failure
   - Have a rollback plan ready

4. **Verify the deployment**:
   ```bash
   # Check database version after deployment
   fastmigrate_check_version --db data/bookdit.db
   ```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Google Books API Not Working
- Verify your API key is correct in `.env`
- Check that the Books API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
- Ensure you haven't exceeded API quotas

#### Books Not Appearing in Search
- Check the console for API errors
- Verify your internet connection
- Try different search terms (title, author, ISBN)

#### Invite Links Not Working
- Ensure `BASE_URL` is set correctly in `.env`
- Check that the invite hasn't expired or reached max uses
- Verify the bookshelf privacy settings

#### Authentication Issues
- Verify your Bluesky handle and app password
- Check that you're using an app password, not your main password
- Ensure the Bluesky service is accessible
